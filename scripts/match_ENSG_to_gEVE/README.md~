# Matching gEVE to Ensembl IDs

Our main approach is to directly align RNA-seq data to endogenous
retroviral sequences. However, we also wanted to look into the
possibility of assessing EVE expression from existing processed count
data using a transcriptome of Ensembl IDs, such as that available from
TCGA.
