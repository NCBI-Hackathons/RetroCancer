# What are Endogenous retroviruses(ERVs)?
"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient active retroviruses that infected germline cells, and these viruses are transmitted vertically through successive generations in a Mendelian fashion. ERVs have undergone repeated amplification and transposition to such an extent that human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which integrated into the human genome 30â€“40 million years ago, currently make up about 8% of the human genome sequence" [ref1](https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4690-8-90)

# Why are these important ?
ERVs lack infectious capacity due to accumulated nonsense mutations,indels of internal coding regions & long terminal repeats (LTRs), which serve as the retroviral promoters. Despite changes HERVs have intact open reading frames (ORFs) that encode functional proteins and in some cases can form retrovirs like particles.[ref2](https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4690-8-90).HERvs along with beneficial roles, have also been associated with a variety of human diseases and disorders. However, no concrete beneficial or harmful effects have yet been establised.[ref3](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep41960)   

# What is retrocancer going to do ?

=======
1. Generation of HERV expression profiles for Cancer Patients
2. Precision Cancer-Therapy based on HERV expression profiles

# What is RetroCancer?
The human genome has about 8% Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) located within it. There have been reports of Human Endogenous Retroviral involvement in certain diseases. In this study, we are analyzing cancer datasets in order to investigate HERVs response to cancer. We therefore seek to measure Human Endogenous Retrovirus Response to Cancer. RetroCancer allows the user to profile HERV expression in cancer datasets. In this study, we are analyzing Melanoma and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) datasets from public databases.

We are developing RetroCancer with the goal of quantifying HERV expression in Melanoma and AML patients, and also classifying these patients based on HERV expression profile and potential response to immunotherapy.
