# RetroCancer

Precision Cancer-Therapy based on HERV expression profiles

# What is RetroCancer?
The human genome has about 8% Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) located within it. There have been reports of Human Endogenous Retroviral involvement in certain diseases. In this study, we are analyzing cancer datasets in order to investigate HERVs response to cancer. We therefore seek to measure Human Endogenous Retrovirus Response to Cancer. RetroCancer allows the user to profile HERV expression in cancer datasets. In this study, we are analyzing Melanoma and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) datasets from public databases.

We are developing RetroCancer with the goal of quantifying HERV expression in Melanoma and AML patients, and also classifying these patients based on HERV expression profile and potential response to immunotherapy.
